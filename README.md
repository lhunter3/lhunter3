## 🚀 About Me

📝 As a bilingual (Français/English) Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick, I have honed my skills in software engineering, including Java and C development, as well as MySQL database management. My experience developing sophisticated music applications, Google Chrome extensions, desktop games, and deploying microservices has allowed me to expand my technical expertise and continue to improve my programming skills.

🏢 In my current student position as a Junior Software Development Engineer at The Barrington Consulting Group, I work closely with a team of developers and analysts to create high-quality software for Java/Spring Boot/Micro-service applications. Utilizing my technical skills, I am responsible for completing both back-end and front-end operations.

🖥️ In my spare time, I am passionate about working on personal projects and continuously refining my programming skills. As a proactive individual, I am dedicated to leveraging my technical abilities to contribute to the success of any team, project, or organization. Additionally, I have a keen interest in web development, music, and sport, and I am confident that my leadership experience and diverse skill set will enable me to make a valuable contribution to any organization.
